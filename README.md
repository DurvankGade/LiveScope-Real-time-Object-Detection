## 🚀 **Project Overview**

> "Transforming raw video into meaningful insights with real-time object detection!"  



LiveScope combines **JavaScript** and **TensorFlow.js** to create a fast, real-time object detection system. The project leverages the **COCO-SSD model**, enabling instant recognition and tracking of multiple objects from video input. Designed with an interactive and user-friendly interface, LiveScope is ideal for numerous real-world applications.

## üíª Code Example

Here's a quick preview of the object detection code that powers LiveScope:

```javascript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';
import * as cocoSsd from '@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd';

const loadModel = async () => {
    const model = await cocoSsd.load();
    console.log('COCO-SSD Model Loaded');
    return model;
};

const detectObjects = async (video, model) => {
    const predictions = await model.detect(video);
    console.log(predictions);
    // Iterate through predictions and display each object with bounding boxes
};
```

---

## üéâ Try It Out

1. Upload a video file and see object detection in action.
2. Track objects as they are detected and labeled instantly.
